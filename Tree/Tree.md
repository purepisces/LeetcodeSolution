ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ **Base Case for dfs**: I will use climbing stairs to illustrate it. At every given point, we have 2 decisions to make, either climb one or two. **When we reach 5**, it is our base case, we're gonna solve this recursively. When reach 5, **return 1**, this is when we find one way. And if this number of steps ever **exceeds five**, this is also the base case, we're going to **return 0**. https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/description/
