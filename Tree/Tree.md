**We are using recursion, so first let's think of the base case.**
___
ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ **Base Case for dfs**: I will use climbing stairs to illustrate it. At every given point, we have 2 decisions to make, either climb one or two. **When we reach 5**, it is our base case, we're gonna solve this recursively. When reach 5, **return 1**, this is when we find one way. And if this number of steps ever **exceeds five**, this is also the base case, we're going to **return 0**. https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/description/

**Inorder Traversal**

In Inorder Traversal, the order of visiting nodes is:

1.  **Visit the left subtree**.
2.  **Visit the root node**.
3.  **Visit the right subtree**.

**Preorder Traversal**

In Preorder traversal, the order of visiting nodes is:

1.  **Visit the root node.**
2.  **Visit the left subtree.**
3.  **Visit the right subtree.**

**Postorder Traversal**

In Postorder traversal, the order of visiting nodes is:

1.  **Visit the left subtree.**
2.  **Visit the right subtree.**
3.  **Visit the root node.**

> ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ Time Complexity: When analyzing recursion, **time complexity** accounts for the **total number of calls** made to the function. In this case, the total number of recursive calls is proportional to the **total number of nodes in the recursion tree**. 
> - At each call to `dfs(i)`, the function does work in the form of making **two recursive calls**: `dfs(i + 1)` and `dfs(i + 2)`.
> -   These recursive calls are **new computations** â€” they explore different paths in the recursion tree and **add to the total number of operations performed**.
> -   Therefore, the total number of recursive calls is proportional to the **total number of nodes in the recursion tree**, which grows exponentially as $O(2^n)$.
> 
> Space Complexity: Each recursive call pushes the current state of the function onto the stack. The maximum depth of the recursion stack is equal to the **depth of the recursion tree**, which is O(n) in this case.

### Total Number of Nodes in a Full Binary Tree

The given tree has nodes doubling at each level, forming a full binary tree. The number of nodes at each level corresponds to the terms of a geometric progression:

$$1, 2, 4, 8, \dots, 2^{h-1}$$

where hhh is the height of the tree.

The total number of nodes in the tree is the sum of the geometric series:

$$S = 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + \cdots + 2^{h-1}$$

The sum of a geometric series can be calculated using the formula:

$$S = \frac{2^h - 1}{2 - 1} = 2^h - 1$$

So, the total number of nodes in the tree is:

$$\text{Total nodes} = 2^h - 1$$

If the tree height $h = n$, the total number of nodes is:

$$\text{Total nodes} = 2^n - 1$$
