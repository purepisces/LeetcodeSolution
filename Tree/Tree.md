ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ **Base Case for dfs**: I will use climbing stairs to illustrate it. At every given point, we have 2 decisions to make, either climb one or two. **When we reach 5**, it is our base case, we're gonna solve this recursively. When reach 5, **return 1**, this is when we find one way. And if this number of steps ever **exceeds five**, this is also the base case, we're going to **return 0**. https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/description/

Time Complexity: O($2^n$) 
Space Complexity: O(n)

> ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ Time Complexity: When analyzing recursion, **time complexity** accounts for the **total number of calls** made to the function. In this case, the total number of recursive calls is proportional to the **total number of nodes in the recursion tree**. 
> - At each call to `dfs(i)`, the function does work in the form of making **two recursive calls**: `dfs(i + 1)` and `dfs(i + 2)`.
> -   These recursive calls are **new computations** â€” they explore different paths in the recursion tree and **add to the total number of operations performed**.
> -   Therefore, the total number of recursive calls is proportional to the **total number of nodes in the recursion tree**, which grows exponentially as $O(2^n)$.
> 
> Space Complexity: Each recursive call pushes the current state of the function onto the stack. The maximum depth of the recursion stack is equal to the **depth of the recursion tree**, which is O(n) in this case.
