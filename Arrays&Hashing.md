Hashtable is essentially a Key-Value-Pair collection where you define the key and the value then you can find the value by using the key. HashSet allowes you to add a value, this value is unique and you do not define the key. Hash Table and Hash Set are the data structures used to store data in the form of key-value pairs and objects respectively.
