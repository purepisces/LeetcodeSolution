Hash Table and Hash Set are the data structures used to store data in the form of key-value pairs and objects respectively. Python's dict is a built-in HashMap which allows you to store key-value pairs. We can create a dictionary (serves as both Hashtable and HashMap). HashSet in Python (Using set).

## Hashmap
HashMap allows one null key and multiple null values, whereas Hashtable does not allow any null key or value.

## Hashtable
Hashtable is essentially a Key-Value-Pair collection where you define the key and the value then you can find the value by using the key.
A key aspect of a Hashtable is that it doesn't allow null keys or values.
## Hashset
HashSet allowes you to add a value, this value is unique and you do not define the key.
