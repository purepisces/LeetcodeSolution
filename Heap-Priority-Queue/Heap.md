### **What is a Heap?**

A **heap** is a special binary tree data structure where:

-   **Min-Heap:** The parent node is always smaller than or equal to its children. This means the smallest element is always at the root.
-   **Max-Heap:** The parent node is always greater than or equal to its children, and the largest element is always at the root.

Pythonâ€™s `heapq` module implements a **min-heap** by default. It provides methods to create and manipulate heaps efficiently.

-   **`heapq.heapify`**: Converts an unordered list into a min-heap.
-   **`heapq.heappop`**: Removes and returns the smallest element from the heap.
-   **`heapq.heappush`**: Adds a new element to the heap and maintains the heap property.



703. Kth Largest Element in a Stream: https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-largest-element-in-a-stream/description/

```python
class KthLargest:
    def __init__(self, k: int, nums: List[int]):
        # minHeap w/ K largest integers
        self.minHeap, self.k = nums, k
        heapq.heapify(self.minHeap)
        while len(self.minHeap) > k:
            heapq.heappop(self.minHeap)

    def add(self, val: int) -> int:
        heapq.heappush(self.minHeap, val)
        if len(self.minHeap) > self.k:
            heapq.heappop(self.minHeap)
        return self.minHeap[0]
```
