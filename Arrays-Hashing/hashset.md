A HashSet is a data structure used in various programming languages, most notably Java and C#. It is designed to store a collection of unique elements, providing fast operations for adding, removing, and checking the presence of elements. 

Uniqueness: Each element in a HashSet is unique. If you try to add a duplicate item, it won't be added again, maintaining a collection of distinct elements.
