                    resLen = r - l + 1
                l -= 1
                r += 1

            # even length
            l, r = i, i + 1
            while l >= 0 and r < len(s) and s[l] == s[r]:
                if (r - l + 1) > resLen:
                    res = s[l : r + 1]
                    resLen = r - l + 1
                l -= 1
                r += 1
        return res
```
for example, Input: s = "babad", make s[0] be the center, and check its left and right, then make s[1] be the center expland to its left and right.

Need to consider the odd length and even length, since consider "dd", it is even length, if center at s[0], it will not expand to its left if considering odd length, so we need to consider even length.
