ğŸŒŸğŸŒŸğŸŒŸğŸŒŸğŸŒŸ  My inituition here is that if the subproblem is same, we can just use a cache to store it, so we don't need to calculate it again. Must read **reading climbing stairs.md** which illustrate this dp concept excellent! Not using dfs in decision tree, but elimate similar trees to avoid repeat work. Basically the dynamic programming solution where we are caching the result aka memorization.
