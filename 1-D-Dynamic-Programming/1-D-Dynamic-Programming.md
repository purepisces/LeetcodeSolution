ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ  My inituition here is that if the subproblem is same, we can just use a cache to store it, so we don't need to calculate it again. Must read **reading climbing stairs.md** which illustrate this dp concept excellent! Not using dfs in decision tree, but elimate similar trees to avoid repeat work. **Basically the dynamic programming solution where we are caching the result aka memorization.**

why don't we start at the bottom solve the base case and then work our way up to the original problem at 0? This is called a **bottom up dynamic programming.** look at **reading climbing stairs.md**
