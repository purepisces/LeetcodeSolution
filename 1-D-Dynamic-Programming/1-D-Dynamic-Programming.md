ğŸŒŸğŸŒŸğŸŒŸğŸŒŸğŸŒŸ **Base Case**: I will use climbing stairs to illustrate it. At every given point, we have 2 decisions to make, either climb one or two. When we reach 5, it is our base case, we're gonna solve this recursively. When reach 5, return 1, this is when we find one way. And if this number of steps ever exceeds five, this is also the base case, we're going to return zero.
